# Introduction
This project is a freetime projet with Zad-sixstrings for holiday period. Working together on **EmulatorJS**. Zad making the Frontend with a brand new visual theme. On my side, i'm building a a Backend node.js app to implement saving of the game on a PostgreSQL server

# Who's this for?
This is basically for us to play around and having some "fun" coding. But its also free to anyone who want to implement it on their side. Full documentation will be made in the futur.

# How it will work?
Use a PostgreSQL database for hosting users, games informations, save file, devices,...  
Use Ã  Node.JS app to provide multiple API to communicate between **EmulatorJS** and the **PostgreSQL** database

# What's the actual status
Actually the backend stuff is still in dev. There still a lot of functionnality to integrate.

# Roadmap
- [x] Saving file on a Table through an API  
- [x] Loading file from a Table through an API
- [ ] Implement user authentification  
- [ ] Implement user profile data

*and many more to come*

# Disclaimer
We do ***not*** provide any ROM of game, neither we promot IP violation. provide your own ROM file from dumped cartridges or any **legal** channel.<br>
I'm also not a professional coder, code may have error, security issue,... Bear in mind i cannot be held as responsible if any critical data have been compromised (hacked, encrypted, stolen,...)
